az20.tsv
--- Example quantitative phosphoproteomics (QP) data file from QMUL. Used to check whether phosphosite IDs I've generated can be matched up with QP data files.

Disease-associated-sites
--- File downloaded from phosphosite.org listing phosphosites and their corresponding diseases. This gets processed by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb to give usable csv file (phosphosites_diseases.csv) for use in database.

human_kinase_dataframe.csv
--- File generated by Katie listing human kinases and associated details from UniProt.

inhib_kin.csv
--- File listing inhibitor-kinase pairs for use in database. Generated by Web-scraping-KIDFamMap_2-of-2_Inhibitor-information-and-csv-generation.ipynb.

Inhibitor files explanation.txt
--- File listing and explaining field names in inhibitors.csv and inhib_kin.csv.

inhibitors.csv
--- File listing inhibitors for use in database. Generated by Web-scraping-KIDFamMap_2-of-2_Inhibitor-information-and-csv-generation.ipynb.

Kinase_Substrate_Dataset
--- File downloaded from phosphosite.org listing phosphosites and their corresponding kinases. Processed by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb to give usable csv file (kinases_phosphosites.csv) for use in database.

kinases_phosphosites.csv
--- File listing phosphosites and their corresponding kinases for use in database. Generated by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb.

phosphoELM_vertebrate_2015-04.dump
--- File downloaded from phospho.ELM listing phosphosites. Processed by Phosphosite-data-processing-1-of-2-Phospho.ELM-downloaded-file.ipynb for use in database. Output processed further by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb.

Phosphorylation_site_dataset
--- File downloaded from phosphosite.org listing phosphosites. Processed by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb to give usable csv file (phosphosites.csv) for use in database.

Phosphosite files explanation.txt
--- File listing and explaining field names in phosphosites.csv, kinases_phosphosites.csv and phosphosites_diseases.csv.

Phosphosite-data-processing-1-of-2-Phospho.ELM-downloaded-file.ipynb
--- Jupyter notebook that processes phosphosite data from the file phosphoELM_vertebrate_2015-04.dump, downloaded from phospho.elm online resource.

Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb
--- Jupyter notebook that generates three csv files of phosphosite data: phosphosites.csv, kinases_phosphosites.csv and phosphosites_diseases.csv by processing phosphosite data from four files Phosphorylation_site_dataset, Kinase_Substrate_Dataset, Disease-associated_sites (downloaded from phosphosite.org online resource) and the partially processed data from phospho.ELM (phosphosites_2.csv).

phosphosites.csv
--- File listing phosphosites for use in database. Generated by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb.

phosphosites_2.csv
--- File listing phosphosites, which is NOT for use in database. This is processed by Processed by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb along with three raw files from phosphosite.org to give usable csv files for use in database.

phosphosites_diseases.csv
--- File listing phosphosites and their corresponding diseases for use in database. Generated by Phosphosite-data-processing-2-of-2-Phosphosite.org-downloaded-files.ipynb.

Sanity-check-script-for-phosphosite-and-inhibitor-tables.ipynb
--- Jupyter notebook that performs sanity checks on the five phosphosite and inhibitor files

Web-scraping-KIDFamMap_1-of-2_Kinase-IDs.ipynb
--- Jupyter notebook that uses web scraping spider to retrieve kinase names from KIDFamMap online resource. Should be followed by running Web-scraping-KIDFamMap_2-of-2_Inhibitor-information-and-csv-generation.ipynb to generate inhibitors.csv and inhib_kin.csv.

Web-scraping-KIDFamMap_2-of-2_Inhibitor-information-and-csv-generation.ipynb
--- Jupyter notebook that generates two csv files of inhibitor data: inhibitors.csv and inhib_kin.csv. Uses web scraping spider to retrieve data from KIDFamMap online resource. Depends on earlier running of Web-scraping-KIDFamMap_1-of-2_Kinase-IDs.ipynb.
