Human Kinase Dataframe Explanation file

COLUMN HEADER MEANINGS
- Entry_name: UniProt entry name, containing "_HUMAN"
- UniProt_ID: Unique UniProt accession number in the form of letters (capitalised) and numbers
- Primary_Protein_Name: Main name given to the kinase, i.e. most common name
- Alternate_Protein_Names(s): Other names the kinase goes by
- Gene_Symbol: Main symbol given to the gene encoding the kinase, i.e. most common symbol
- Alternative_Gene_Name(s): Other gene symbols the gene encoding the kinase goes by
- Families: The superfamily and family the kinase belongs to
- AA_Seq: Amino acid sequence of the kinase
- Molecular_Mass_(Da): The molecular mass of the kinase in daltons
- Subcellular_Location: Cellular location in which the kinase is found to be active within

MANUAL CLEAN UP OF RESULTING FILE
*** This was done in Excel and a text editor ***
Excel -> using the find and replace function
- Column D (Alternate_Protein_Name(s)):
	- Remove "[", "]" and "'"
- Column F (Alternative_Gene_Name(s)): 
	- Remove "[", "]" and "'"
- Column J (Subcellular_Location):
	- Remove ", .", ",.", "NA.", "}" and "{"
Text editor -> manually going to the TITIN_HUMAN entry
- In Excel, the TITIN_HUMAN sequence is too large for an excel cell, and thus spans multiple cells
- Going to a text editor and merging these cells (removing commas) restores this entry to the way it originally was

WARNING!!!
- If going to open this file in excel, do not save it as it will remove the formatting of the TITIN_HUMAN entry
