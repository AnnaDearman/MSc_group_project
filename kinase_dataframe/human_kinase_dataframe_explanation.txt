COLUMN HEADER MEANINGS
- UniProt_ID: Unique UniProt accession number in the form of letters (capitalised) and numbers
- PDB_ID: The Protein Data Bank (PDB) identification number that the UniProt accession number corresponds to
- PDB_URL: The URL of the structure image of the kinase that correlates to the aforementioned PDB ID
- PDB_title: The given name of the structure corresponding to the image URL and PDB ID
- Entry_name: UniProt entry name, containing "_HUMAN"
- Primary_Protein_Name: Main name given to the kinase, i.e. most common name
- Alternative_Protein_Names(s): Other names the kinase goes by
- Gene_Symbol: Main symbol given to the gene encoding the kinase, i.e. most common symbol
- Alternative_Gene_Name(s): Other gene symbols the gene encoding the kinase goes by
- Families: The superfamily and family the kinase belongs to
- AA_Seq: Amino acid sequence of the kinase
- Molecular_Mass_(Da): The molecular mass of the kinase in daltons
- Subcellular_Location: Cellular location in which the kinase is found to be active within

WARNING!!!
- The sequence for the TITIN_HUMAN entry is too long to be contained in one excel cell, and thus will span multiple cells when the file is opened in excel
- If going to open this file in excel, do not save it as it will remove the formatting of the TITIN_HUMAN entry, causing it to span two lines, splitting it into
  two entries rather than one
