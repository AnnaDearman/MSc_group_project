--- Phosphosite ID made by combining GENE and MOD_RSD
- ISOFORM
--- "0" or "1" to indicate whether record relates to an isoform ("1" = isoform). Use records with "0" for canonical protein.
- ID_PH
--- Primary key

kinases_phosphosites.csv
- GENE
--- Gene name / GENENAME for the kinase
- IN_VIVO_RXN
